It generates a set of files where ligands (we use water, but you could pick something else)
are placed at random positions around a molecule within a sphere centered at a user defined point;
so, for example, the sphere doesnâ€™t need to be centered at the origin of the molecule,
it could be centered around a specific moiety of the molecule.
